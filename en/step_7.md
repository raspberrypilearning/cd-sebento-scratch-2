## Final tweaks

On this card you'll make a few small changes to control things like the speed of the animation. Customise the changes to suit your own program!

+ Change the number of steps after the `stamp`{:class="block3extensions"} from `20` to `4`. You'll probably need make the first `move`{:class="block3motion"} bigger, maybe `60` instead of `45`, to get the glass of water out from behind the text sprite again.

+ Move the `wait`{:class="block3control"} out of the first loop and put it after the loop instead, but still inside the `repeat until`{:class="block3control"} loop, and change the value to `1` or `2` seconds, or whatever you like.

+ Test it out, and tweak the numbers to suit you!

+ Finally, why not add a `say`{:class="block3looks"} block to have the sprite display the number of litres of water being shown?

+ I'm also adding in some code at the very end to change the sprite back to the monkey and get the user to think about ways to conserve water.

Here is how the whole program looks now, do you can check it if something in yours is not working right:
